<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>MiniLibX - Simple X-Window Interface Library for students</p>
<h1>SYNOPSYS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;mlx.h&gt;</p>
<pre><code>void *</code></pre>
<p><strong>mlx_init</strong> ();</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>MiniLibX is an easy way to create graphical software, without any
X-Window programming knowledge. It provides simple window creation, a
drawing tool, image and basic events management.</p>
<h1>X-WINDOW CONCEPT</h1>
<p>X-Window is a network-oriented graphical system for Unix. It is based
on two main parts:<br />
On one side, your software wants to draw something on the screen and/or
get keyboard &amp; mouse entries.<br />
On the other side, the X-Server manages the screen, keyboard and mouse
(It is often refered to as a "display").<br />
A network connection must be established between these two entities to
send drawing orders (from the software to the X-Server), and
keyboard/mouse events (from the X-Server to the software).</p>
<h1>INCLUDE FILE</h1>
<p><strong>mlx.h</strong> should be included for a correct use of the
MiniLibX API. It only contains function prototypes, no structure is
needed.</p>
<h1>LIBRARY FUNCTIONS</h1>
<p>First of all, you need to initialize the connection between your
software and the display. Once this connection is established, you'll be
able to use other MiniLibX functions to send the X-Server messages, like
"I want to draw a yellow pixel in this window" or "did the user hit a
key?".</p>
<p>The <strong>mlx_init</strong> function will create this connection.
No parameters are needed, ant it will return a <em>void *</em>
identifier, used for further calls to the library routines.</p>
<p>All other MiniLibX functions are described in the following man
pages:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>mlx_new_window</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>: manage windows</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>mlx_pixel_put</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>: draw inside window</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>mlx_new_image</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>: manipulate images</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>mlx_loop</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>: handle keyboard or mouse events</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>LINKING MiniLibX</h1>
<p>To use MiniLibX functions, you'll need to link your software with
several libraries, including the MiniLibX library itself. To do this,
simply add the following arguments at linking time:</p>
<p><strong>-lmlx -lXext -lX11</strong></p>
<p>You may also need to specify the path to these libraries, using the
<strong>-L</strong> flag.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUES</h1>
<p>If <strong>mlx_init()</strong> fails to set up the connection to the
X server, it will return NULL, otherwise a non-null pointer is returned
as a connection identifier.</p>
